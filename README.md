Inspired by: https://teamtreehouse.com/library/css-selectors/going-further-with-attribute-selectors-and-pseudoclasses/firstchild-and-lastchild
(and subsequent videos)

The purpose of this exercise is to develop a list using pseudo-classes such as:

1. :first-child
2. :last-child
3. :only-child
4. :empty
5. :nth-child

The end result was a zebra-striped list with no border at the bottom, a simple application of the five pseudo-classes mentioned above.
